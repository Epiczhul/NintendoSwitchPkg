# EDK2 Implementation for Nintendo Switch (Tegra210)

## Status
Not quite useful right now. Capable to boot something from SD card (need cold boot sequence). Then Windows Kernel chokes with the current memory region.

## Building
See [Lumia950XLPkg](https://github.com/WOA-Project/Lumia950XLPkg). Almost identical!
